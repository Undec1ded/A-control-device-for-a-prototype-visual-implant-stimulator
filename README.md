# A-control-device-for-a-prototype-visual-implant-stimulator
Development of a control device for a prototype visual implant stimulator. The set targets, objectives and technical specifications are set by the specifics of the final qualification work and the parameters of the customer.  The main language - system verilog.

The logic programming task is divided into 2 modules "receive, process the signal" and "generate a sequence of control DAC signals". Two modules are responsible for receiving data and processing data: the receiving signal to the UART interface "UART\_load\_data", the processing signal "Load\_data". The logic of the sequence of output signals controlling the DAC is divided into four modules: frequency divider "Frequency\_divider\_SCLK", pulse duration control "Generate\_impulse", voltage switching "Logic", data transmission to the DAC "SPI". Combining the "Top" modules.
